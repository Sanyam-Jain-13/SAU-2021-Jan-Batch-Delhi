            India started its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday with healthcare workers getting vaccinated in the first
            phase. More than three crore healthcare and frontline workers will be immunized during the first phase of Covid-19 
            vaccination drive and the technology 
            partner that will support the exercise at the digital front is the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network or Co-WIN 
            application.
            <br>
            The software will monitor the inoculation drive and track the beneficiaries of the vaccination. 
            It will facilitate real-time information about vaccine storage temperature, stocks etc. 
            But the Co-WIN app is not available on either Android or Apple app stores to download which means one cannot 
            get registered for the vaccine shot until further announcement.
